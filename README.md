# Personal stats

Git-scraping stats from diverse sources for personal amusement.

The goal of this repo is to fetch data across different sources on a schedule to have a good way to keep track of my activities.

Data is mostly anonimized hence why repo is public.

## `strava.csv`

Activities from strava captured on a spreadsheet. I use IFTTT Strava -> Google Sheet to store it.
